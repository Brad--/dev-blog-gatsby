Test Post Please Ignore

# Update
Editing the test post with [Prose](https://github.com/prose/prose). Is this the right editor for me? Is image upload gonna work? This is a nicer markdown editor, I guess, but it'll be a bit more work to get the images working. I was expecting this to be more than just Markdown! Sure is easy, though.

It does seem that this uses a more verbose date than "mm/dd/yyyy" which is what I would prefer. I don't think the time I make the post matters much. I'm not sure the extra data gets displayed though. We'll see once this is live!

Sometimes you just got make things _italic_ or maybe **bold**.

Let's see if the image uploading works this time, now that I'm using the proper /src directory

This was easy to do with [gatsby-remark-images](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-images/)! Now I need to update the prose syntax for images though. Hmm.
