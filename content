Is this the right editor for me? Is image upload gonna work? This is a nicer markdown editor, I guess, but it'll be a bit more work to get the images working. I was expecting this to be more than just Markdown! Sure is easy, though.

It does seem that this uses a more verbose date than "mm/dd/yyyy" which is what I would prefer. I don't think the time I make the post matters much.
